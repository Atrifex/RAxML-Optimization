RAxML can't, parse the alignment file as phylip file 
it will now try to parse it as FASTA file

IMPORTANT WARNING: Alignment column 4522 contains only undetermined values which will be treated as missing data
// basically says that the 4522 nucleotide in each sequence has undetermined value. Thus is ignored
// 75 down 22 to the right


IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences AAAAAAAAAM and AAAAAAAABU are exactly identical


IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences AAAAAAAAAW and AAAAAAAACP are exactly identical

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 2 sequences that are exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.


IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 1 column that contains only undetermined values which will be treated as missing data.
Normally these columns should be excluded from the analysis.

An alignment file with undetermined columns and sequence duplicates removed has already
been printed to file 23S.E/R0/cleaned.alignment.fasta.reduced


Using BFGS method to optimize GTR rate parameters, to disable this specify "--no-bfgs" 


Alignment has 1 completely undetermined sites that will be automatically removed from the input data

// ALL OF THIS WAS SET UP OF DATA

Alignment has 6492 distinct alignment patterns

Proportion of gaps and completely undetermined characters in this alignment: 59.72%

RAxML rapid hill-climbing mode

Using 1 distinct models/data partitions with joint branch length optimization


Executing 1 inferences on the original alignment using 1 distinct randomized MP trees

All free model parameters will be estimated by RAxML
ML estimate of 25 per site rate categories

Likelihood of final tree will be evaluated and optimized under GAMMA

GAMMA Model parameters will be estimated up to an accuracy of 0.1000000000 Log Likelihood units
